/**
 * Triangle bending model. The triangle bending model creates bending constraints for each pair of triangles that share an
 * edge. The goal is to keep the dihedral angle for the rest and deformed position consistent. The class implements
 * two different models based on a quadratic bending energy as well as measuring the dihedral error directly. See
 * EvaluateQuadratic() and EvaluateDihedral().
 *
 * The bending model is rotation and translation invariant. EvaluateQuadratic() is scale invariant in the sense that the energy is the same no matter how you scale the
 * rest and deformed vertices, but the scale needs to be consistent for both meshes. EvaluateDihedral() is scale invariant
 * in the sense that both rest vertices and deformed vertices can have completely different scales.
 *
 * Note regarding scale invariance: you need to be careful when integrating the bending constraint with other constraints
 * that may not be scale invariant (e.g. point to point constraint) or otherwise an energy minimization will result in
 * different results depending on the global scale of the data. You can anchieve this by globally modify the bending energy
 * by passing in a global bending weight.
 *
 * Note that testing on spherical triangle meshes has shown that the bending energy is not equal to the integrated
 * squared mean curvature. TODO: figure out why this is not the case.
 *
 * Implemented for T=float and T=double.
